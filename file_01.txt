Happy Homework on day 1!

.gitignore files:

A way to identify files or directories that you do not want or do not
need to be part of the source control that Git provides.

You can set up 'rules' for this globally, through parent directories
and within the folder that contains a Git repository itself, and
there is a hierarchy for these rules.
