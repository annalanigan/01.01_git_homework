Happy Homework on day 1!

.gitignore files:

A way to identify files or directories that are not important to,
or do not need to be part of the source control that Git provides.

You can set up 'rules' for this globally, through parent directories
and within the folder that contains a Git repository itself, and
there is a hierarchy for these rules.

They can be identified by file/directory name or by file type (and 
using a * wildcard).
